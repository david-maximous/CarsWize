# CarsWize

This Project was individual for Introduction to Web Programming Module in BUE Prep Year
It was required to use only one CSS sheet without using any frameworks or libraries and only 3 pages (Home, Reservation, and Contact US)

It's not responsive since I couldn't use Bootstrap or any external libraries but I hope you Like it

All the images that I used them have Creative Commons license

You're free to use or develop it, but metion the source of it !
